#### What is a web host?
A web host provides a location on the web where your website files are stored, plus additional services that allow your website to be viewed. If you’re a beginner, it’s generally recommended to get your domain and hosting from the same provider as it makes it easier to configure and manage. Bluehost and Godaddy.com are two popular hosting service providers that offer a wide set of useful features.


#### What is a domain name?
A domain name is the address of your website that people type into the browser to visit your website. For example, famous.co will bring you to the Famous website.

#### How do I host my Famous project on a web hosting service?
The hosting process is unique to each hosting provider. We strongly advise you to follow your hosting provider’s instructions for the best results. The following information provides an example of how to publish the downloaded source files generated from your design.

- Step 1: Choose a hosting provider and set up an account if you don’t - already have one.
- Step 2: Purchase a web hosting plan.
